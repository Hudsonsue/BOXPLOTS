This is a Jupyter Notebook that looks at Box plots. 
It is a submission by student ID G00219132. 
    
The submission is for Project 2018 for the Module **Fundamentals of Data Analysis** The module is delivered as part of the [Higher Diploma in Data Analytics](https://www.gmit.ie/computing/higher-diploma-science-computing-data-analytics-ict-skills) in [Galway Mayo IT](https://www.gmit.ie/), Galway.

The notebook itself is called **BOX PLOTS.ipynb** and to run it you will ideally have [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine. You can install this via the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) python Distribution.  

It is in programming language - Python 3.7.0.For some information about Python and it's uses see the wikipedia page, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))

The project instructions can be found in the pdf called **project.pdf** within this repository.

**Three datasets are included in the repository**

mock up points.csv - this is a mock up of CAO points for a programme across two years
boxplotdata.csv - this is a mock up of CAO points for a programme across six years with some data issues
boxplotdatacleaned.csv - this is boxplotdata.csv with incorrect data points removed

Please note all data is simulated and while broadly representative, in some cases changes across terms are deliberately exaggerated to emphasise different boxplot 'shapes'.
